    "# Winning_Money_In_Jeopardy\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It has been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we worked with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win. The dataset is named `jeopardy.csv`, and contains **20000** rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file). Here's the beginning of the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='jeopardy_beginning_rows.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "We may see above that each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Show Number` -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- `Air Date` -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- `Round` -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- `Category` -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- `Value` -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- `Question` -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- `Answer` -- the text of the answer."
